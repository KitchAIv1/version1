## 📱 **FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE**

### **State Management & Caching**
```typescript
// React Query Integration
interface CacheStrategy {
  profileData: "5-minute cache with background refresh";
  followStatus: "30-second cache for responsive UI";
  feedData: "30-second cache with real-time invalidation";
  likeCounts: "Optimistic updates with server reconciliation";
}

// Cache Invalidation Strategy
followAction → invalidateQueries(['profile', targetUserId])
profileUpdate → invalidateQueries(['followers', 'following'])
likeAction → optimisticUpdate + backgroundRefetch
```

### **Hook Architecture**
```typescript
// Core Hooks (All Operational)
useFollowMutation.ts: Complete follow/unfollow functionality
  ├── Parameter alignment with backend RPC functions
  ├── Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
  ├── Cache invalidation for real-time UI updates
  └── Optimistic updates for responsive interactions

useProfile.ts: Enhanced profile data management
  ├── Real-time follower count updates
  ├── AI recipe badge integration
  ├── Chronological recipe sorting
  └── Background refresh for stale data

useActivityFeed.ts: Social feed integration
  ├── Follow activity tracking
  ├── Real-time updates for new followers
  ├── Infinite scroll with optimized loading
  └── Pantry matching for personalized content
```

### **Navigation & User Experience**
```typescript
// Navigation Hierarchy (Fully Implemented)
AuthStack: Login/Signup → Onboarding → Main App
MainStack: {
  BottomTabs: [Feed, Pantry, Grocery, Profile],
  ModalScreens: [RecipeDetail, EditRecipe, AIGeneration],
  OnboardingFlow: [Step1, Step2, Final]
}

// User Flow Optimization
profileNavigation: "One-tap access to follow buttons and lists"
recipeDiscovery: "AI-powered recommendations with pantry matching"
socialInteractions: "Real-time like/follow feedback with animations"
```

---

## 🔒 **SECURITY & COMPLIANCE**

### **Authentication & Authorization**
```sql
-- Row Level Security (100% Coverage)
user_follows: authenticated users can view all, modify own
recipe_uploads: creators can modify own, everyone can read public
user_interactions: users can only modify own interactions
profiles: public profile data accessible, private fields protected

-- Function Security (All Functions Secured)
SECURITY DEFINER: All RPC functions run with elevated privileges
auth.uid() validation: Every function validates calling user
Parameter validation: SQL injection prevention on all inputs
Error handling: Secure error messages without data leakage
```

### **Data Privacy & Protection**
```typescript
interface PrivacyCompliance {
  publicData: "Only public profiles and recipes accessible";
  privateData: "Email, internal IDs properly protected";
  followRelationships: "Publicly viewable (standard social pattern)";
  userControl: "Users can unfollow, delete account (future)";
  dataRetention: "GDPR-compliant data handling";
  encryption: "All data encrypted in transit and at rest";
}
```
