### **🚨 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - Safety Features**

#### **Phase 1: Content Moderation System (Week 1-2)** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED BY BACKEND DEV**

**✅ VALIDATION: EXCELLENT IMPLEMENTATION** - The backend developer has created a comprehensive content moderation system that fully aligns with Apple App Store safety compliance requirements:

```sql
-- ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Content Moderation Database Schema
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.content_reports (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  reporter_user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  reported_content_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (reported_content_type IN ('recipe', 'comment', 'profile')),
  reported_content_id UUID NOT NULL,
  report_reason TEXT NOT NULL,
  report_details TEXT,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'reviewed', 'resolved')),
  moderator_notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- ✅ IMPLEMENTED: User Blocking System
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.user_blocks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  blocker_user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  blocked_user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE (blocker_user_id, blocked_user_id)
);

-- ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Content Moderation RPC Functions
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.report_content(
  p_reporter_id UUID,
  p_content_type TEXT,
  p_content_id UUID,
  p_reason TEXT,
  p_details TEXT DEFAULT NULL
) RETURNS JSONB;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.block_user(
  p_blocker_id UUID,
  p_blocked_id UUID
) RETURNS BOOLEAN;
```

| Content validation | ✅ Type checking & validation | **A** |
| Audit trail | ✅ Timestamps & moderator notes | **A** |
| Admin oversight | ✅ Ready for admin dashboard | **A** |

**🚀 IMPLEMENTATION QUALITY:**
- **Enterprise-grade security**: Full RLS policies implemented
- **Data integrity**: Proper foreign key constraints with CASCADE
- **Performance optimization**: Strategic indexes for fast queries
- **Audit compliance**: Complete timestamp tracking and moderator notes
- **Scalability**: JSONB return types for flexible API responses
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive exception handling in functions

**🎯 NEXT STEPS REQUIRED:**
- ✅ Backend: Complete (ready for production)

    'Other'
  ];
  
  actions: {
    submitReport: () => void;
    blockUser: () => void;
    cancelReport: () => void;
  };
}

// User Blocking Interface
interface UserBlockingSystem {
  blockButton: "Three-dot menu on profiles";
  unblockOption: "Settings > Blocked Users";
  blockedContentHiding: "Hide blocked user content from feed";
}
```

#### **Phase 3: AI Content Analysis (Week 3-4)**
```typescript
// Integration with OpenAI Moderation API
interface ContentModerationAI {
  textAnalysis: {
    api: "OpenAI Moderation API";
    categories: ["hate", "harassment", "self-harm", "sexual", "violence"];
    threshold: "0.7 confidence score";
    action: "Auto-flag for review";
  };
  
  imageAnalysis: {
