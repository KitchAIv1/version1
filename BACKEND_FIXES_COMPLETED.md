  user_id_param: userId,
  recipe_id_param: recipeId
});
```

### Maintained Error Handling:
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages

### Enhanced Data Processing:
- Robust pantry data cleaning
- Null/undefined value filtering
- Consistent data transformation

## 📞 **Next Steps**

### ✅ **Ready for Production**
1. **All critical features working** - Feed, recipe details, likes, pantry matching
2. **Error handling robust** - App handles edge cases gracefully
3. **Performance optimized** - Fast loading and responsive UI
