## 💰 **MONETIZATION STRATEGY**

### **FREEMIUM Model (Conversion-Optimized)**
```typescript
interface MonetizationStrategy {
  freemiumLimits: {
    pantryScan: {
      limit: "3 scans per month";
      value: "Essential for recipe matching";
      upgrade: "Unlimited scans unlock full potential";
    };
    aiRecipes: {
      limit: "10 generations per month";
      value: "Core feature for meal planning";
      upgrade: "25 recipes + priority processing";
    };
  };
  
  premiumBenefits: {
    unlimitedScanning: "Unlimited pantry scans";
    enhancedAI: "25 AI recipes + priority processing";
    advancedFeatures: "Meal planning + nutrition tracking";
    socialBenefits: "Premium badges + creator tools";
    prioritySupport: "Direct support channel";
  };
  
  conversionOptimization: {
    contextualUpgrades: "Limit-specific upgrade prompts";
    valueVisualization: "Clear ROI and benefit communication";
    socialProof: "Premium user success stories";
    urgency: "Monthly reset countdown timers";
    celebration: "Upgrade success celebrations";
  };
  
  pricingStrategy: {
    monthly: "$4.99/month (competitive with Yuka Pro)";
    annual: "$39.99/year (33% discount)";
    lifetime: "$99.99 (limited-time offers)";
    creatorTier: "$9.99/month (enhanced limits + tools)";
  };
}
```

### **Revenue Projections**
```typescript
interface RevenueProjections {
  userAcquisition: {
    month1: "1K+ users (organic + marketing)";
    month3: "5K+ users (viral growth)";
    month6: "15K+ users (product-market fit)";
    month12: "50K+ users (scaling phase)";
  };
  
  conversionMetrics: {
    freemiumToPremium: "5-8% conversion rate";
    averageLifetime: "18 months premium retention";
    monthlyChurn: "<3% (industry leading)";
    upgradeTimeline: "Average 2.3 weeks to conversion";
  };
  
  revenueTargets: {
    month6: "$15K+ MRR (1K premium users)";
    month12: "$100K+ MRR (5K premium users)";
    year2: "$500K+ MRR (15K premium users)";
