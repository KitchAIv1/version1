- End-to-end testing with Detox
- Performance testing under load
- Device compatibility testing
```

### **üü¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Post-Launch Improvements)**

#### **1. Advanced Features**
```typescript
// OPPORTUNITIES:
- Offline functionality for cached recipes
- Siri Shortcuts / Android App Shortcuts
- Widget support for quick actions
- Apple Watch / Wear OS companion
- Dark mode optimization
```

#### **2. Analytics & Monitoring**
